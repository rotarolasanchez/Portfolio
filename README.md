### 🔄 CI/CD Workflow

My CI/CD pipeline is designed to ensure code quality, automate testing, and streamline deployments using **GitHub Actions**. The workflow includes the following automated steps:

1. **Code Linting**: Runs static analysis to enforce coding standards and identify potential issues early.
2. **Unit Testing**: Executes unit tests to validate the functionality of individual components.
3. **Instrumented Testing**: Performs integration tests on emulators to ensure end-to-end functionality.
4. **Code Quality Analysis**: Uses **SonarQube**, running in a Docker container on a DigitalOcean VPS, to analyze code for bugs, vulnerabilities, and maintainability.
5. **Artifact Deployment**: Builds APKs and securely uploads them to Google Drive for distribution.

This pipeline ensures a reliable and efficient development process, catching issues early and maintaining high code quality.

### 🖥️ DevOps Infrastructure

- **VPS**: Hosted on a **DigitalOcean** virtual private server (VPS) for reliable and scalable service deployment.
- **Containerization**: Leveraging **Docker** to containerize and manage services efficiently.
- **Code Quality**: Running **SonarQube** in Docker containers on the VPS to ensure continuous code quality analysis.
